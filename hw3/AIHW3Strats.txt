AIHW3 Strategies:

1. Model opponent and determine expected reward, compare to value of the given offer, accept if it is greater. 
   Model should be hidden markov, but how? Use prob to model the shift in utility expected from opponent?
2. Start with ideal offer. Make offers of slightly lower amounts each time, swapping one of the opponents positions for one of the ones in our last offer.
   If they continue to take utility cuts, keep going. If they don't resend the last offer until they go down. Accept anything with greater utility for us than our last offer.
