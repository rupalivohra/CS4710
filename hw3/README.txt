For rv5rr.py, you may need to install the distance package. I was able to directly download it from a pop up that appeared in PyCharm, but more details are available here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Distance/

Both files depend on calculation permutations, and thus will not work on lists with large elements. More information on this is available in the write up.

The files negotiator_prob.py and negotiator_simple.py are included in case you are curious about the agents we tested against. The ones we want you to grade and run against the class are rv5rr.py and dma3fq.py.

sample_scenario, sample_scenario2, and sample_scenario3 are the different preference lists we tested with. They are included in case you were curious.
